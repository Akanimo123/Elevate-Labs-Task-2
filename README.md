# Elevate-Labs-Task-2

The objective of this task is to create visualizations using a visualization tool (Power BI or Tableau). I utilized the Power BI tool to create my visualizations from a sales dataset. The data was imported and then transformed on the Power Query Editor before use. Apart from the visuals themselves, I also designed the report page by choosing a wallpaper theme on the Themes group in the View tab on Power BI. I inserted a vertical list slicer and a dropdown slicer using the Country and State fields respectively.
